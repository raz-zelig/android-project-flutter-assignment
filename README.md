1.  The class that is used to implement the controller pattern in this library is SnappingSheetController.
    SnappingSheetController can be used by the developer to:
    - set the snapping sheet's current position  by pixels.
    - snap the snapping sheet to a given SnappingPosition.
    - stop an in progress snapping.
    - know if a snapping is in progress.
    - know the current position.
2.  The parameter that controls the type of animation that will be displayed is snappingCurve in the SnappingPosition.factor constructor. 
3.  InkWll produces ripple effect when you tap or long tap the widget below it, while GestureDetector does not.
    In comparison to InkWell, GestureDetector provides control over a larger range of gestures.
